SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE FINAL VERSION:
---------------------------------------
The player is placed in a very realistic, 3-dimensional world with excellent
graphic and sound. His mission is to destroy a great space citadel - an old
idea, but using the 3D engine gave an enormous number of new possibilities.
The action is placed on over 10 levels of different difficulty, all containing
different graphic and environment. The hero cyborg can encounter over 20 types
of intelligent enemies, can use 6 types of weapons - from a simple handgun
to a heavy rocket launcher. He will also face many puzzles and traps - moving
walls, levers and buttons, ID card operated doors, teleports and many, many
more. Of course the action is 100% interactive - the hero gets tired, hurt
and even can get drunk.  There are a lot of different details on all levels -
graphic textured walls, floors and ceilings, collumns, different portable,
movable and unmovable objects. Connected with the dynamic and realistic player
movement and battle and the enemy intelligent actions all this causes that
the game doesn't become monotonous. On A500 playing on a small window and
without floors is recommended (because of the game speed) but on A1200 or
A3000 with fast memory you can freely choose any screen size and detail level.
One of the game advantages is also an excellent, over 2 Mb rendered intro
(all in 4096 colour graphic), inner game and game over animated sequences.
