           THE SAME AGAIN...
    DESERT.... SILENCE... SOLITUDE...



I HAVE BEEN ORBITING ROUND B104-GS12 FOR
SOME  TIME  NOW  WAITING  FOR  HELP FROM
EARTH.    I AM EVEN NOT SURE WHETHER  MY
MESSAGE  HAS  BEEN RECEIVED.  I WILL NOT
STAY ALIVE FOR LONG  HERE - THERE IS NOT
MUCH LIVELIHOOD ON A BOASTER.  



HOWEVER OUR MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED..
OURS...  THE REST  OF THE CREW DIED IN A
SPLIT SECOND AND DID NOT KNOW EVEN  WHAT
WAS GOING ON.     I AM THE  ONLY ONE WHO
SURVIVED. LIFE WITH  A CONCIOUSNESS THAT
I AM THE ONLY ALIVE  OF  MORE  THAN 1000
PEOPLE   IS   A  TORTURE  FOR  ME.   AND
ADDITIONALLY  THE ONES  WHO  DIED IN THE
CITADEL.  



THAT  WHAT HAPPENED  IN  THE CITADEL AND
LED   TO   ALL   THESE  VITIATIONS   AND
MUTATIONS  WILL  PROBABLY  BE  A  SECRET
FOR  EVER. NOW THE CITADEL LIES IN RUIN. 



I  STILL  COME  BACK TO THE LAST MOMENTS
SPENT  IN  THE BASE.  A  DESPERATE   AND
PRACTICALLY   SUICIDAL  ESCAPADE   WHICH
WAS A SUCCESS IN THE END. 

LAYING  THE  ANIHILATION   BOMB  IN  THE
CENTRE... A DESPERATE RUN TO THE BOASTER
WHICH  REMAINED  BY A MIRACLE ON THE AIR
STREEP...    MAD STARTING THE BOASTER...
A HUGE EXPLOSION JUST  BEHIND ME, A HUGE
AIR WAVE...     A DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR
KEEPING   CONTROL  OVER  THE  RUDDERS...
A FINAL SUCCESS - GETTING THE SPACE SHIP
INTO ORBIT...



I  STILL  CALL  FOR  HELP  BY MEANS OF MY
LITTLE EMERGENCY TRAN SMITTER. IS ANYBODY
GONNA HEAR ME?  SHALL ANYBODY COME TO THE
RESCUE?     THE UNIVERSE IS SO TREMENDOUS
 - THERE  ARE  MANY, MANY  LIGHT-YEARS TO
THE EARTH.  




 HOWEVER THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED.

      THE CITADEL DOES NOT EXIST.
        NOW ONLY ME... AND HOPE.
            HOPE FOR RESCUE.







                 THE END
