FRAGMENTS  OF  THE  DIARY FOUND AT THE CORPSE OF
THE SECOND PILOT OF SCOUT 01, 08.06.2305:
                                               
    "...IT'S  BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE WE  LEFT THE
EARTH.  OVER 950 SOLDIERS  AND 120 CREWMEN - ALL
CLOSED  IN  OUR TEMPORARY HOME:  X16  -  A LARGE
INTERGALACTIC CRUISER,USED AS A BASE FOR LANDING
TROOPS SUCH AS OUR. THE TARGET OF OUR EXPEDITION
CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET, APPEARED YESTERDAY ON THE
SCREENS - A SMALL PLANET, MARKED ON STELLAR MAPS
AS B104-GS12..."
              

    " ... JUST TODAY WE WERE TOLD THAT UNDER THE
SURFACE OF B104-GS12  THERE  IS  A LARGE COMPLEX
OF SECRET ARMY  LABORATORIES,  MAINLY BIOLOGICAL
AND GENETIC  -  KNOWN  AMONG  THE  INITIATED  AS
"THE CITADEL". PRISONERS  FROM  A  SMALL  PRISON
COMPLEX   WITHIN   THE   CITADEL  WERE  USED  AS
WORKFORCE AND OBJECTS OF EXPERIMENTS.
                
ABOUT THREE  MONTHS  AGO  COMMUNICATION WITH THE
CITADEL SUDDENLY BROKE. THE  WAR COUNCIL DECIDED
TO SEND AN  ARMED  SQUAD  - THAT IS US - TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
MEANWHILE THE CITADEL STILL REMAINS SILENT..."
  " ...BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RESEARCH
WORKS  AT  THE  CITADEL  OUR  AIM  HAS BEEN MADE
CLEAR:   RESTORE COMMUNICATION WITH AND ORDER IN
THE BASE.IF THIS PROVES IMPOSSIBLE - DESTROY IT.

THE LAST  PREPARATIONS  FOR LANDING ARE UNDERWAY
ON BOARD:  TRAINING, TESTING WEAPONS, INSPECTION
OF  BOASTERS  (SHORT RANGE FIGHTERS)  AND SCOUTS
(SMALL RECONNAISSANCE CRAFT) AND TRAINING AGAIN.
                                       
OUR COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS  AND DEFENCE SYSTEMS
BROKE  DOWN  SUDDENLY.   NOW   WE   ARE  TOTALLY
DEFENCELESS ..."
    "... OUR ENGINEERS ARE TRYING HARD TO PUT IN
ORDER OUR DEFENCE SYSTEMS FIRST OF ALL.  WITHOUT
THEM WE ARE DEAF AND BLIND  FOR WHAT IS GOING ON
AROUND US AND WE MAKE  A GOOD AIM FOR A POSSIBLE
ENEMY.

MEANWHILE IT HAS BEEN DECIDED TO SEND A SCOUT TO
B104-GS12.I AM TO GO AS THE SECOND PILOT.I DON'T
KNOW THE FIRST PILOT - I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW
EVERYBODY  OUT  OF  A  THOUSAND  MEN  ON  BOARD.
I'VE HEARD RUMOURS HE IS A SCREWNUT.
                      
I HAVE TO GET READY. LAUNCHING IN 30 MINUTES..."
"...SO WE HAVE STARTED - ME AND THE FIRST PILOT.
HE DIDN'T  EVEN  INTRODUCE  HIMSELF TO ME.   OUR
TARGET  IS  TO  ORBIT   B104-GS12  SCANNING  ITS
SURFACE. NEXT WE ARE TO ENTER ITS ATMOSPHERE AND
MAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE  CITADEL SITUATED IN ONE
OF THE MANY CRATERS ON THE SURFACE.

                      
WE  HAVE  BEEN  WARNED  OF THE AUTOMATIC DEFENCE
SYSTEM OF THE CITADEL.IT IS USUALLY INACTIVE,BUT
IT MIGHT  HAVE  CHANGED  IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
WE WILL HAVE A CLOSE LOOK... "                
                                  
            "... I MUST ADMIT I'M A BIT NERVOUS.
RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS ARE NOT THE SAFEST JOBS.
WE  ARE  LEAVING  BEHIND  THE  X16 -  OUR FLYING
FORTRESS, NOW TOTALLY DEFENCELESS.


                                    
 WHAT'S THAT?!...  ON THE SIDE SCREEN WE NOTICED
AN OBLONG OBJECT DASHING NEAR US TOWARDS X16...

             
 WAS THAT A MISSILE ?! ... "

   "...EMPTINESS ... SILENCE ... SOLITUDE...

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT... WE ARE NOW ON OUR OWN...
DOZENS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM THE EARTH - IT'S
LIKE INFINITY. THERE'S NO RETURN....

        ... ONLY US... AND THE CITADEL...

       MYSTERIOUS. DANGEROUS. IMPREGNABLE.
                OUR LAST CHANCE.

WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.
SOON WE WILL HAVE TO LAND... "
AFTER  ENTERING  THE  ATMOSPHERE  OF  B104-GS12,
SCOUT 01  WAS  DAMAGED BY THE  AUTOMATIC DEFENCE
SYSTEM OF THE CITADEL. DURING EMERGENCY LANDING,
WHICH  WAS EXTREMELY ROUGH, THE SECOND PILOT GOT
KILLED.

THE FIRST PILOT SURVIVED THE CRASH ALMOST UNHURT
ALONE AND HELPLESS ON A HOSTILE PLANET.

HE SLOWLY APPROACHED A NEARBY EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
TO THE COMPLEX.   HE WAS DESPERATE AND READY FOR
ANYTHING.
                ONLY HIM... AND THE CITADEL.
