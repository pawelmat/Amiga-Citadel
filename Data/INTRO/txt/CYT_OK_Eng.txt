FRAGMENTS OF A DIARY FOUND AT THE CORPSE OF THE SCOUT'S 01 
CO-PILOT, 08.06.2305: 

"... IT IS THE SECOND MONTH SINCE WE LEFT EARTH. OVER  950 SOLDIERS AND 120 MEMBERS OF THE CREW - ALL LOCKED AT OUR  TEMPORARY HOME: X16 - A HUGE, SUPERSPACIOUS OPERATIONAL  SPACE SHIP USED AS A BASE FOR LANDING TROOPS LIKE OURS. THE  PURPOSE OF THE EXPEDITION KEPT AS YET SECRET APPEARED ON  SCREENS YESTERDAY - A SMALL PLANET  MARKED ON  STELLAR MAPS AS B104-GS12..."  

"... ONLY TODAY WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS A HUGE COM PLEX OF SECRET MILITARY LABORATORIES UNDER THE SURFACE OF  B104-GS12, BIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC FIRST OF ALL, KNOWN AMONG  THE INITIATED AS THE "CITADEL". MEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH FROM  A LITTLE PENAL COLONY OF THE PLACE ARE FORCED TO WORK HARD AND THEY ARE USED FOR TESTS THERE.  

ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO THE CONTACT WITH THE CITADEL STOPPED.  AFTER A MEETING, THE MILITARY GALAXY COUNCIL DECIDED TO SEND  AN ARMED RECONNOITRING DETACHEMENT - US - TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION. AT PRESENT THE CITADEL KEEPS SILENT..."  

"... CONSIDERING THE DIGNITY OF THE RESEARCH WORKS TAKING  PLACE IN THE CITADEL OUR GOAL HAS BEEN SPECIFIED UNIVOCALLY  - RESTORE THE CONTACT, RESTORE ORDER IN THE BASE IF NEEDED,  DESTROY THE OBJECT IF NECESSARY. THE FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR  THE LANDING TAKE PLACE ON THE BOARD. TRAININGS, WEAPONS'  CLEANING AND INSPECTION, INSPECTING AND FUELING UP THE BOAS TERS (SUPERSPACIOUS FIGHTER PLANES) AND SCOUTS (SMALL RECON NOITRING UNITS) AND TRAININGS AGAIN...  

..SUDDENLY OUR COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND DEFENCE SYSTEMS  STOPPED WORKING. WE ARE COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS..."  "...INFORMATICS AND EQUIPMENT EXPERTS TRY TO RESTORE AT  LEAST OUR DEFENCE SYSTEM TO WORK. WE ARE AN EXCELLENT AT TACK'S OBJECT WITHOUT IT - DEAF AND BLIND TO EVERYTHING  GOING ON OUTSIDE. 

MEANWHILE A DECISION OF SENDING  A  RECONNOITRING  SCOUT  TO   B104-GS12 WAS TAKEN. I AM DUE TO BE THE CO-PILOT OF THE  SCOUT. I DO NOT KNOW THE FIRST PILOT AT ALL - IT IS NOT POS SIBLE TO KNOW EVERYONE OF OVER 1000 PEOPLE. HE IS SAID TO BE  A MADCAP...  

I HAVE TO GET READY. WE START IN HALF AN HOUR..."  "...SO WE START - ME AND THE FIRST PILOT. HE DID NOT EVEN  INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO ME. OUR PURPOSE IS TO GET INTO A VERY  LOW ORBIT, REVOLVE ROUND THE PLANET SEVERAL TIMES AND TAKE  SOME PICTURES AND MEASUREMENTS. THEN WE HAVE TO GET INTO THE  ATMOSPHERE AND TAKE PICTURES AND MEASUREMENTS OF THE CITADEL  WHICH IS PLACED IN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS SURFACE CRATERS.  WE WERE WARNED OF  THE  AUTOMATIC  DEFENCE  SYSTEM  OF THE  CITADEL - IT WAS USUALLY SWITCHED OFF BUT DURING THE LAST  THREE MONTHS QUITE A LOT COULD HAVE CHANGED. WE WILL WATCH  EVERYTHING FROM A SHORT DISTANCE..."  

"...I MUST ADMIT THAT I AM GETTING NERVOUS. SUCH MISSIONS DO  NOT BELONG TO  THE  SAFEST ONES. WE  LEAVE THE X16 - OUR MO BILE FORTRESS, ACTUALLY ENTIRELY DEFENCELESS.  WHAT'S THAT?!... WE BOTH NOTICED AN OBLONG OBJECT WHICH  FLITTED NEAR US IN THE DIRECTION OF X16...  IS THAT SO? ... A ROCKET !?..."  

"... DESERT.... SILENCE... SOLITUDE...
 ... I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT ... WE DEPEND ON OURSELVES ONLY. MANY, MANY LIGHT-YEARS FROM THE EARTH - IT WILL BE AGES. WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF RETURN. 
... ONLY US ... AND THE CITADEL. 
HOSTILE. GRIM. IMPREGNABLE. OUR LAST CHANCE. 
FUEL IS RUNNING OUT. 
WE ARE FORCED TO LAND ... " 

AFTER GETTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE PLANET THE SCOUT 01  WAS DAMAGED BY THE CITADEL'S AUTOMATIC DEFENCE SYSTEM. DU RING A VIOLENT EMERGENCY LANDING THE CO-PILOT DIED.  THE FIRST PILOT GOT OFF SAFE AND SOUND FROM THE DISASTER. ALONE AND SOLITUDE ON A HOSTILE PLANET.  HE BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE NEARBY EMERGENCY ENTRANCE OF  THE COMPLEX. DRIVEN TO DESPAIR AND READY TO DO EVERYTHING.  ONLY HIM ... AND THE CITADEL.

DESERT.... SILENCE... SOLITUDE... 

I HAVE BEEN  ORBITING  ROUND  B104-GS12 FOR  SOME TIME NOW  WAITING FOR HELP FROM EARTH. I AM EVEN NOT SURE WHETHER  MY MESSAGE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. I WILL NOT STAY ALIVE FOR LONG  HERE - THERE IS NOT MUCH LIVELIHOOD ON A BOASTER.  

HOWEVER OUR MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED... OURS... THE REST  OF THE CREW DIED IN A SPLIT SECOND AND DID NOT KNOW EVEN  WHAT WAS GOING ON. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO SURVIVED. LIFE WITH  A CONCIOUSNESS THAT I AM THE ONLY ALIVE OF MORE THAN 1000  PEOPLE IS A TORTURE FOR ME. AND ADDITIONALLY THE ONES WHO  DIED IN THE CITADEL.  

THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITADEL AND LED TO ALL THESE VITIATIONS AND MUTATIONS WILL PROBABLY BE A SECRET FOR EVER. NOW THE CITADEL LIES IN RUIN. 

I STILL COME BACK TO THE LAST MOMENTS SPENT IN THE BASE. A DESPERATE AND PRACTICALLY SUICIDAL ESCAPADE WHICH WAS A SUCCESS IN THE END. 

LAYING THE ANIHILATION BOMB IN THE CENTRE... A DESPERATE RUN  TO THE BOASTER WHICH REMAINED BY A MIRACLE ON THE AIR STREEP... MAD STARTING THE BOASTER...A HUGE EXPLOSION JUST  BEHIND ME, A HUGE AIR WAVE... A DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR KEE PING CONTROL OVER THE RUDDERS... A FINAL SUCCESS - GETTING  THE SPACE SHIP INTO ORBIT...  

I STILL CALL FOR HELP BY MEANS OF MY LITTLE EMERGENCY TRAN SMITTER. IS ANYBODY GONNA HEAR ME? SHALL ANYBODY COME TO THE  RESCUE? THE UNIVERSE IS SO TREMENDOUS - THERE ARE MANY, MANY  LIGHT-YEARS TO THE EARTH.  

HOWEVER THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED. 

THE CITADEL DOES NOT EXIST. 
NOW ONLY ME... AND HOPE. 
HOPE FOR RESCUE.
THE END
