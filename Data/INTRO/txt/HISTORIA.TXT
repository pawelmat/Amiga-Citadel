FRAGMENTS OF A DIARY FOUND AT THE CORPSE 
OF THE SCOUT'S 01 CO-PILOT, 08.06.2305: 
"... ÿIT ÿIS ÿTHE ÿSECOND MONTH SINCE WE 
LEFT ÿTHE ÿEARTH. ÿOVER 950 SOLDIERS AND 
120 ÿMEMBERS OF THE CREW - ALL LOCKED AT 
OUR ÿÿTEMPORARY ÿHOME: ÿX16 ÿ- ÿA ÿHUGE, 
SUPERSPACIOUS ÿÿOPERATIONAL ÿSPACE ÿSHIP 
USED ÿAS ÿA BASE FOR LANDING TROOPS LIKE 
OURS. THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPEDITION KEPT 
AS ÿÿYET ÿÿSECRET ÿAPPEARED ÿON ÿSCREENS 
YESTERDAY ÿ- ÿA ÿSMALL PLANET DENOTED ON 
SPACE MAPS AS B104-GS12..." 

"... ÿONLY ÿTODAY WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT 
THERE ÿIS A HUGE COMPLEX OF SECRET MILI-
TARY ÿLABORATORIES ÿUNDER THE SURFACE OF 
B104-GS12, ÿBIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC FIRST 
OF ALL, KNOWN AMONG THE INITIATED AS THE 
"CITADEL". MEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH FROM A 
LITTLE ÿPENAL ÿCOLONY ÿOF ÿTHE PLACE ARE 
FORCED ÿTO ÿHARD WORK AND USED FOR TESTS 
THERE. 

ABOUT ÿTHREE MONTHS AGO THE CONTACT WITH 
THE CITADEL STOPPED. AFTER A MEETING THE 
MILITARY ÿGALAXY COUNCIL DECIDED TO SEND 
AN ÿARMED RECONNOITRING DETACHEMENT - US 
- TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION. FOR THE PRE-
SENT THE CITADEL KEEPS SILENT..." 
"... ÿCONSIDERING THE DIGNITY OF THE RE-
SEARCH WORKS TAKING PLACE IN THE CITADEL 
OUR GOAL HAS BEEN SPECIFIED UNIVOCALLY - 
RESTORE ÿTHE ÿCONTACT, ÿRESTORE ORDER IN 
THE ÿBASE ÿIF NEEDED, DESTROY THE OBJECT 
IF NECESSARY. THE FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR 
THE ÿLANDING ÿTAKE ÿPLACE ÿON THE BOARD. 
TRAININGS, WEAPONS' CLEANING AND INSPEC-
TION, ÿINSPECTING AND FUELING UP THE BO-
ASTERS ÿ(SUPERSPACIOUS ÿFIGHTER ÿPLANES) 
AND ÿSCOUTS ÿ(SMALL RECONNOITRING UNITS) 
AND TRAININGS AGAIN... 

...SUDDENLY ÿOUR ÿCOMPUTER COMMUNICATION 
AND ÿDEFENCE SYSTEMS STOPPED WORKING. WE 
ARE COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS..." 
"...INFORMATICS ÿAND ÿEQUIPMENT ÿEXPERTS 
TRY TO RESTORE AT LEAST OUR DEFENCE SYS-
TEM ÿÿTO ÿÿWORK. ÿWE ÿARE ÿAN ÿEXCELLENT 
ATTACK'S ÿOBJECT ÿWITHOUT ÿIT - DEAF AND 
BLIND TO EVERYTHING GOING ON OUTSIDE.
 
MEANWHILE A DECISION OF SENDING A RECON-
NOITRING SCOUT TO B104-GS12 WAS TAKEN. I 
AM ÿDUE TO BE THE CO-PILOT OF THE SCOUT. 
I DO  NOT  KNOW THE FIRST PILOT AT ALL - 
IT ÿIS ÿNOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW EVERYONE OF 
OVER ÿ1000 ÿPEOPLE. ÿHE ÿIS SAID TO BE A 
MADCAP... 

I HAVE TO GET READY. WE START IN HALF AN 
HOUR..." 
"...SO ÿWE ÿSTART - ME AND THE FIRST PI-
LOT. ÿHE ÿDID NOT EVEN INTRODUCE HIMSELF 
TO ME. OUR PURPOSE IS TO GET INTO A VERY 
LOW ÿORBIT, REVOLVE ROUND THE PLANET SE-
VERAL ÿTIMES ÿAND TAKE SOME PICTURES AND 
MEASUREMENTS. ÿTHEN ÿWE HAVE TO GET INTO 
THE ATMOSPHERE AND TAKE PICTURES AND ME-
ASUREMENTS ÿOF THE CITADEL WHICH IS PLA-
CED ÿIN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS SURFACE CRA-
TERS. 

WE WERE WARNED AGAINST THE AUTOMATIC DE-
FENCE ÿSYSTEM ÿOF ÿTHE ÿCITADEL - IT WAS 
USUALLY SWITCHED OFF BUT DURING THE LAST 
THREE ÿMONTHS ÿQUITE ÿA ÿLOT ÿCOULD HAVE 
CHANGED. WE WILL WATCH EVERYTHING FROM A 
SHORT DISTANCE..." 

"...I ÿMUST ADMIT THAT I AM GETTING NER-
VOUS. SUCH MISSIONS DO NOT BELONG TO THE 
MOST ÿSAFE ÿONES. WE LEAVE THE X16 - OUR 
MOBILE ÿFORTRESS, ÿACTUALLY ENTIRELY DE-
FENCELESS. 

WHAT'S ÿTHAT?!... WE BOTH NOTICED AN OB-
LONG OBJECT WHICH FLITTED NEAR US IN THE 
DIRECTION OF X16... 
IS THAT SO? ... A ROCKET !?..." 
ÿ"... DESERT.... SILENCE... SOLITUDE...

 ... I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT ... WE DEPEND 
ON OURSEVES ONLY. MANY, MANY LIGHT-YEARS 
FROM ÿTHE ÿEARTH - IT IS AGES. WITHOUT A 
POSSIBILITY OF RETURN. 
        ... ONLY US ... AND THE CITADEL. 

HOSTILE. ÿGRIM. ÿIMPREGNABLE. ÿOUR ÿLAST 
CHANCE. 

FUEL IS RUNNING OUT. 
WE ARE FORCED TO LAND ... " 
AFTER GETTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE 
PLANET SCOUT 01 WAS DAMAGED BY THE CITA-
DEL'S AUTOMATIC DEFENCE SYSTEM. DURING A 
VIOLENT ÿEMERGENCY ÿLANDING THE CO-PILOT 
DIED. 

THE ÿFIRST ÿPILOT GOT OFF SAFE AND SOUND 
OF THE DISASTER. ALONE AND SOLITUDE ON A 
HOSTILE PLANET. 

HE BENT HIS STEPS TO THE NEARBY EMERGEN-
CY ÿENTRANCE ÿOF ÿTHE COMPLEX. DRIVEN TO 
DESPAIR AND READY TO DO EVERYTHING. 
           ONLY HIM ... AND THE CITADEL. 
koniec 

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿTHE SAME AGAIN... 

ÿÿÿDESERT.... SILENCE... SOLITUDE... 

I HAVE BEEN ORBITING ROUND B104-GS12 FOR 
SOME ÿTIME NOW WAITING FOR HELP FROM THE 
EARTH. ÿI ÿAM ÿEVEN ÿNOT SURE WHETHER MY 
MESSAGE ÿHAS ÿBEEN ÿRECEIVED. I WILL NOT 
KEEP ÿALIVE FOR LONG HERE - THERE IS NOT 
MUCH LIVELIHOOD ON A BOASTER. 

HOWEVER ÿOUR ÿMISSION ÿHAS ÿBEEN FULFIL-
LED... OURS... THE REST OF THE CREW DIED 
IN ÿA SPLIT SECOND AND DID NOT KNOW EVEN 
WHAT WAS GOING ON. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO 
SURVIVED. ÿLIFE WITH A CONCIOUSNESS THAT 
I ÿAM ÿTHE ÿONLY ALIVE OF MORE THAN 1000 
PEOPLE IS A TORTURE FOR ME. AND ADDITIO-
NALLY THE ONES WHO DIED IN THE CITADEL. 

THAT ÿWHAT ÿHAPPENED ÿIN THE CITADEL AND 
LED ÿTO ÿALL ÿTHESE VITIATIONS AND MUTA-
TIONS ÿWILL ÿPROBABLY ÿBE ÿA ÿSECRET FOR 
EVER. NOW THE CITADEL LIES IN RUIN. 

I ÿSTILL ÿCOME ÿBACK TO THE LAST MOMENTS 
SPENT IN THE BASE. DESPERATE AND PRACTI-
CALLY SUICIDAL ESCAPADE WHICH WAS A SUC-
CESS IN THE END. 

LAYING ÿTHE ANIHILATION BOMB IN THE CEN-
TER... ÿA ÿDESPERATE ÿRUN ÿTO ÿA BOASTER 
WHICH ÿREMAINED ÿBY A MIRACLE ON THE AIR 
STREEP... A MAD STARTING THE BOASTER...A 
HUGE ÿEXPLOSION ÿJUST ÿBEHIND ME, A HUGE 
AIR WAVE... A DEPERATE STRUGGLE FOR KEE-
PING CONTROL OVER THE RUDDERS... A FINAL 
SUCCESS ÿ- ÿGETTING ÿTHE SPACE SHIP INTO 
ORBIT... 

I ÿSTILL ÿCALL ÿFOR ÿHELP BY MEANS OF MY 
LITTLE EMERGENCY TRANSMITTER. IS ANYBODY 
GONNA HEAR ME? SHALL ANYBODY COME TO THE 
RESCUE? ÿTHE UNIVERSE IS SO TREMENDOUS - 
THERE ÿARE MANY, MANY LIGHT-YEARS TO THE 
EARTH. 

HOWEVER THE MISSION HAS BEEN FULFILLED. 
ÿÿÿÿÿÿTHE CITADEL DOES NOT EXIST. 
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿNOW ONLY ME... AND HOPE. 

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿHOPE FOR RESCUE.

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿTHE END
