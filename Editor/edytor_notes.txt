
Colours:
- cols.dat is the indexed palette, formatted as 2 bytes per colour: 0R GB
- the first 20 colours are fixed and must not be changed. The last 12 can be changed

Enemy stats:
No A:
- ABC: Energy (0-1000?)
- DEF: Speed (0-1000?)
With A switched on:
- ABC: hits, hits, weapon

"ChoiceId":
0 door, button, wall
  - left click selects normal wall, right click inverted version
1 teleport, column, column up, column down
2 item
3 enemy
4 blood
5 tables - i.e. signs and card slots - the additional things that you can stick on walls
6 block (?) - B (no draw)
  - This works on doors. When Block (click left) is in a map position, doors next to that position are blocked and do not automatically open.
  - brick #50 is printed on the map which changes the door colour to light green
7 player/end - P (no draw). Clicking Left on "P" puts down player start (red), clicking right on "P" puts down the level end marker (green)
  - Player has pos and start angle (from enemy tab entry 0?), E takes only cursor pos
  - brick #18 is printed on the map

The ID of the actual element selected, or e.g. 0100 0000 in case of block

CursorPos table:
0 X
2 Y
4 cursor direction (up down left right)

Map (40x80?) -> 64x64 (32k + actions + enemies)
- each element has 8 bytes, 
  - 0-3 per each direction of the wall
		- 1 bit LSB: wall invert (you select this by right selecting the wall)
		- 5 bits: 0 - 31 wall index. 
		- 2 MSB: blood index, 00 - no blood, other 3 are blood stains
  - 4 tables (signs) - 2 bits for each direction for 4 walls around the corresponding square
  - 5 column
	- 0001 1111 (on LSB 5 bits)
	- 00x0 		x=0 upper, x=1 lower
  - 6 item / block
	- 0001 1111 (on LSB 5 bits) or maybe 0011 1111. There are 20 items that can be displayed (-1 which is the "hand")
	- 0100 0000 block bit. This means that the square cannot be traversed
  - 7 enemy

- T <from loc> <to loc>
- G <button loc> <action 1> <pos 1> <action 2> .... -2 <actions when button released>

OD <pos> - open door
CD <pos> - close door
SB <pos> set Block (i.e. doors around that loc do not automatically open)
